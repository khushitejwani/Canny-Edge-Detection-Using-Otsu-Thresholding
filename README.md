# Canny-Edge-Detection-Using-Otsu-Thresholding

Canny is a classic algorithm of edge detection which has been widely applied in various fields of image processing for years. However, the algorithm has some defects. 
The most serious defect is that the traditional canny algorithm canâ€™t set threshold adaptively. 
If the threshold set manually is not accurate, it will seriously affect the quality of the algorithm to detect the edge. This makes the poor adaptability of the algorithm.

I have performed the application of a method which combines maximum entropy method with Otsu method to determine the high and low threshold of Canny algorithm.
